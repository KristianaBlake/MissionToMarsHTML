Breakfast and dinner are eaten with the entire crew. One hour is dedicated to breakfast, while an hour and a half is dedicated to dinner. </p> 

                    <p class="food-p"> Commensality is an important aspect of our daily life because it gives us Martians the time to remember that we are not alone.  </p>
